# JavaScript Algorithms and Data-Structures
This repository contains popular data-structures and algorithms written in JavaScript.

## Data Structures
A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format
that enables efficient access and modification.
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values,
the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

# JavaScript Algorithms and Data-Structures
This repository contains popular data-structures and algorithms written in JavaScript.

The inspiration of this project comes from [this](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms).
But the repository contained many potential bugs in avl tree and red black tree.
Also the segment tree is optimized by using bit operations. 

## Data Structures
A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format
that enables efficient access and modification.
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values,
the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

The repository contains following data-structures
* [Doubly Linked List](/src/data-structure/doubly-linked-list)
* [Linked List](/src/data-structure/linked-list)
* [MinHeap](/src/data-structure/heap)
* [MaxHeap](/src/data-structure/heap)
* [Priority Queue](/src/data-structure/priority-queue)
* [Trees](/src/data-structure/trees)
    * [AVL Tree](/src/data-structure/trees/avl-tree)
    * [Binary Search Tree](/src/data-structure/trees/binarySearchTree)
    * [Fenwick Tree(Binary indexed trees)](/src/data-structure/trees/fenwickTree)
    * [Red Black Tree](/src/data-structure/trees/red-black-tree)
    * [Segment Trees](/src/data-structure/trees/segmentTree)
